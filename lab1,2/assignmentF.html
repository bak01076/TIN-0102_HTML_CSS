        <article class="contentBox">
            <p>Earlier, in a phone call to Fox News, the President called on Barr to open a preelection probe into his false claims that the former vice president is guilty of corruption in Ukraine -- the country that Trump tried to coerce into interfering in the election to damage Biden in an abuse of power that<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/20/politics/2020-election-trump/index.html"> got him impeached.</a>
                "We've gotta get the<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/20/politics/2020-election-trump/index.html">  attorney general to act.</a> He's gotta act. And he's gotta act fast," Trump said in the interview. "This is major corruption and this has to be known about before the election."
                The demand was the latest indication of how Trump has no compunction about using the powers of his office -- meant to be reserved for the American national interest -- to try to damage his political foes in full public view.</p>

            <h2>India is facing a health threat: pollution and the pandemic</h2>
        </header>
        <article class="contentBox">
            <p>New Delhi (CNN)A familiar scene is taking place in northern India. Vast fields burn, flames engulfing bare stalks of already-harvested crops. Billowing smoke travels across state borders. In towns and cities,<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/21/asia/india-pollution-covid-intl-hnk-scn-wellness/index.html">the air is thick with yellow haze.</a> 
                Stubble burning, the practice of intentionally setting fire to cultivated fields to prepare the land for its next crop, is one of the chief drivers of India's so-called annual pollution season, which begins each winter.
                It is especially bad in cities like the capital New Delhi, where smog from the burning crop fields, vehicular emissions, power plants, construction sites, and smoke from Diwali firecrackers combine to create a toxic cloud that lingers until spring.</p>

            <h2>Earthquake interrupts Prime Minister's interview</h2>

            <p><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/20/europe/iceland-earthquake-interview-scli-intl/index.html"> Iceland's Prime Minister was interrupted by an earthquake while filming an interview on Tuesday</a> -- but managed to shrug off the intrusion and finish her answer.
                Katrin Jakobsdottir was discussing the impact of the pandemic on tourism with the Washington Post when her house started to shake, visibly startling the Icelandic leader.
                "Oh my god, there's an earthquake," she said with a gasp. "Sorry, there was an earthquake right now. Wow."
                But Jakobsdottir quickly pivoted back to the matter at hand, laughing: "Well this is Iceland" and continuing her response to the question.</p>

            <h2>Biden has a clear path to 270</h2>
        </header>
        <article class="contentBox">
            <p>Another riotous day at the White House unfolded with Trump, who is desperate not to be the <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/20/politics/2020-election-trump/index.html"> first President since George H.W. Bush ousted after a single term, trailing Biden in enough swing states to cost him the election.</a>
                CNN Poll of Polls averages across 10 key battleground states suggest tight races heading into the final two weeks of the campaign in seven states and Biden ahead in the other three. Crucially, the averages suggest Biden holds a sizable lead in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, which could form a path for him to get to the magic number of 270 electoral votes.</p>
